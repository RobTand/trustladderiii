# TL3 controller

`tl3-controller` connects the pure kernel to the Postgres store and upstream
executors. Read [the architecture note](../../docs/architecture.md) for the
transaction and recovery contracts.

All commands use the same TOML configuration as `tl3-config`. Controller execution
supports explicit simulation only. Status commands read the configured store
and do not load GitHub or model credentials.

Both commands use `Config::load`, which checks secret-file metadata, including
the optional store password. Only the store reads its password at runtime.
`tl3 status` uses `Reader::open`. It never migrates or writes and
reports an uninitialized database clearly.

```text
tl3 status --config /absolute/path/to/config.toml
tl3 status-serve --config /absolute/path/to/config.toml
tl3d --config /absolute/path/to/config.toml --simulate /absolute/path/to/fake-records
```

The daemon reads one JSON `cli::Input` per line on stdin. For example:

```json
{"LabelledIssue":{"delivery":"fixture-42","owner":"RobTand","repo":"tl3-sandbox","installation":1,"number":42,"title":"Fix the sandbox build","actor":24923402,"label":"tl3"}}
```

The example repository, installation and actor must match the configuration.
Fake receipts live outside the controller process. Keep their directory when
restarting against the same database. `--drain` recovers persisted work and exits
without reading stdin. EOF ends an interactive simulation.

Register a replacement executor with one `Registry::register` call. The five
modules under `src/adapters` each contain a fake. The controller owns interning
and persistence. Executors own authoritative reconciliation and epoch fencing.
`adapters::simulation` builds the fake registry. A test starts
with it and replaces one entry with `register`. The `mixed_registry` scenario
uses the real `tl3-worktrees` client in a temporary repository and delegates
the remaining worktree effects to its fake. The other four upstreams stay fake.

Each adapter ticket extends `Delivery` with the fields its real client needs.
The tracer does not predefine issue text, branch text, or PR text fields.

`tl3 status` and the page share `status::load`, one typed model and one set
of columns. They show the issue title and number, phase, wait, credit, last
progress and open incidents. Older requests without a title show "title not
recorded". Both progress and incidents show "none recorded" until their store
data exists. Tickets #9 and #15 fill `status::load_request_details`. It takes all
node IDs at once and returns a map from node ID to `RequestDetails`, using batch
queries on the existing read-only transaction. Missing entries use the empty
details. Return public summaries there, never
worker payloads, connection settings or tokens.

`tl3 status-serve` is a separate process from `tl3d`. It serves `/` with GET
and HEAD, needs no login and refuses other methods with 405. Reload the page
to refresh it. The server uses `config.status.listen`; the example binds only
to `127.0.0.1:8033`. Initialize the database through the controller before
opening status. Status checks the schema and migration version before reading;
an empty database reports "database not initialized". Status never runs migrations
or creates request data. After a connection failure, the page reopens its single
reader and retries once. Failed reads return a generic 503.

The synchronous HTTP server uses four handler threads and caps accepted open
connections at eight, including queued clients. Extra connections close immediately.
Reading headers and writing each response have separate two-second total deadlines.
Each socket requests a 32 KiB send buffer to bound queued replies.
Response writes use chunks and the remaining deadline, so trickle readers cannot
keep a handler indefinitely. Accept errors are logged and skipped; file-table
exhaustion also backs off briefly. Each 503 logs its cause to stderr without
including it in the HTTP body. Queries on `/` are ignored. Request lines plus headers are
limited to 8 KiB. Request bodies are rejected and every response closes its
connection. Responses keep the content security policy and disable caching.

Ticket #19 owns deployment on dl380g10, the systemd unit and the LAN address.
The page has no authentication. Run the status process in its own unit and set
`[status].listen` to the LAN interface's specific address, never `0.0.0.0` or
`[::]`. The status connection uses the `[store]` settings. A SELECT-only
Postgres role can also restrict the status process's credentials.

Run development verification through PrismaBuild from a clean commit:

```bash
python3 /mnt/shared/prismabuild-fleet/repo/tools/pbrun.py \
  --cwd "$PWD" --anywhere --cpus 2 --demand mem_gb=6 --priority -10 \
  --env PATH=/home/rob/.cargo/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin \
  --env RUSTUP_HOME=/home/rob/.rustup --env CARGO_HOME=/home/rob/.cargo \
  --env CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 --env RUST_TEST_THREADS=2 \
  --env OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 --env MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 --env OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 \
  --detach -- bash crates/controller/tools/verify.sh
```

Run this from the repository root. Use `pbwait.py --endings KEY` and inspect the
exit code, logs and verified CAS receipt. CI runs separately on Mergify runners.

`adapters::simulation_with_workers` replaces ingest, audit and maker with Python
worker processes and returns a `WorkerOutputSource`. Plan and review remain on
the worker fake. Supply issue and repository text through `Store::put_worker_materials`
before dispatch. Audit reads the stored ingest reply. An ingest revision reads
the audit's objections. Missing materials block dispatch.

Maker materials use a `maker` object in that same per-node record. It contains
the node's `brief`, `goals` with stable string IDs, `plan.checks`, and any
accumulated `feedback`. A fix round requires feedback. Ingress supplies the
brief slice and findings; the supervisor supplies authoritative `plan.files`,
`attempt`, `round`, context and fit limits, PrismaBuild settings, and Hindsight
endpoint from the delivery and config. Other roles can also use named objects
in the materials record; the flat ingest/audit format still works.

The maker uses `worktrees_root/OWNER/REPO/issue-ISSUE-node-NODE`, matching #61's
worktree adapter. It never uses an empty per-run directory as a checkout.
Until #61 merges, the maker acceptance fixture creates that git worktree itself.
Attempt N selects `models.maker[N - 1]` for both rounds. The kernel alone
advances attempts. Each attempt has a conversation outside the worktree under
`workers.runs/sessions`; round 1 resumes it, while a new attempt starts fresh.
Worker code commits a completed change and computes a conservative fit bound
for additional files. The controller interns returned heads and requested paths
before delivering kernel replies. It stores the latest reply as `maker_replies`.

Maker acceptance runs the actual Python entry point and maker graph with a
scripted model, fake read-only Hindsight, and recorded self-check results.
The worktree and PrismaBuild adapters stay fake until #61 and #62 merge.
Scenarios cover success, failed checks through both rounds of all three attempts
and one re-plan, an actual commit outside the footprint, requested files,
context exhaustion, unmet goals, invalid output, recovery, and stop.

Run `WorkerOutputSource::run(sender)` on its own ingress thread. It emits
`cli::Input::Observation` and writes progress to a separate store table. Until
#10 supplies the shared daemon loop, simulations can call `poll_once` and feed
its channel to `Controller::observe`. The stdin-only daemon keeps its existing
fake registry until that loop can register this source.

Each effect key owns a directory of immutable attempts. stdout and stderr are
files. A Python supervisor records its identity before launching the worker,
waits for it, fsyncs output and publishes its exit status. The worker wrapper
records its identity before exec. Atomic claims also let recovery cancel a
launcher that has not started. No file locks are used. Machine ID, PID, process start time
and boot ID identify each process. A record from another machine stays unknown. Stop uses pidfds and waits for termination.
Keep these runs on the controller's host, including after a restart.
For #19, workers and their supervisors must live outside the controller's kill
scope. Use systemd `KillMode=process` for the controller or put workers in their
own scope. Otherwise stopping the controller kills the workers too.

Sync the worker environment once at deployment with
`uv sync --locked --project /srv/tl3/workers --python 3.14+gil`.
Set `workers.python` to its `.venv/bin/python`. Each launch uses that interpreter
directly, without uv cache or venv locks. `workers.command` contains Python's
arguments, normally `-m tl3_workers run`.

The source watches only active runs with inotify for output and exit records,
and pidfds for process exits. A durable per-key notification registers a new
attempt. Completed runs leave the watched set. Startup reads the store watches
and run directories once to rebuild it. Stop indexes active runs by node.

Only a valid role reply followed by exit zero is accepted. A recorded failed
exit reports `RunFailed`. A lost supervisor record is absent only after both
identities are proven dead and delayed launches are fenced. The controller
reports absence of an acknowledged worker as `RunFailed`; an uncertain start
can retry the same key. The source emits only `Found` evidence, never `Absent`
or a cancelled claim. The controller watch owns confirmed absence.
If a supervisor dies while its worker lives, recovery waits for that worker.
A valid reply without a recorded exit is discarded, and the run is redone.
This is the safe path because nobody proved a successful process exit.
No clock or liveness threshold makes this decision.

`Store::worker_progress` reads the last progress for every run, optionally
filtered by request node. `Store::worker_document` reads briefs, goals and audit
replies. Replaying output does not refresh progress time. These reads do not
claim controller ownership. `tl3_worker_progress` records `run_key`, `node_id`,
`epoch`, `attempt`, `started_ms`, `output_offset`, `unit`, and nullable
`last_progress_ms`. A start row exists before the first progress event.
Replaying a claim or output does not refresh its timestamp. Ticket #15 can
measure silence from `started_ms`. Ticket #18's status hook receives a
`Transaction` and queries this table directly in its read-only snapshot.

Submit `bash crates/controller/tools/verify-workers.sh` through PrismaBuild to
run the process acceptance scenarios. They run the actual worker entry point
with a fake model and deny network calls. They kill workers and controllers
with SIGKILL, check reattachment, exercise invalid and premature replies, and
verify the goals delivered to the GitHub fake.

For the review-fix evidence, create a clean detached worktree at the final
commit, then generate the campaign there:

```bash
python3 crates/controller/tools/review_manifest.py > /tmp/tl3-review-campaign.json
python3 /mnt/shared/prismabuild-fleet/repo/tools/pbcampaign.py --detach /tmp/tl3-review-campaign.json
```

The campaign adds the kernel tests and three Kani harnesses covering retryable
acknowledgements, publishing transitions, and queued progress. Read each terminal
record, log, and CAS receipt before reporting a pass.

## Add a worker role

For #11, #12 and #13, update each boundary together:

- Add the kernel role mapping in `adapters/workers/protocol.rs` `role`.
- Map and validate the reply in `map_reply`, using the package's role schema.
- Validate role inputs in `validate_inputs`.
- Build inputs and select the model ladder in `Supervisor::request`.
- Extend `lib.rs` `valid_role` and the document names in `translate`.
- Add process scenarios for accepted replies, invalid output, recovery and stop.

Ticket #11 replaces `IngestDone { size: 1 }`. The forecaster owns sizing.
Until these boundaries support a role, its starts and stops use the worker fake.

Worker tests resolve `TL3_TEST_UV` first, then `uv` on PATH. Missing uv fails
with an installation message. They sync the locked Python 3.14 environment once
per test process. Run the process scenarios on dl380g10, sparky and sparklina
through PrismaBuild with `--tag HOST`. From a clean detached worktree, run
`python3 crates/controller/tools/worker_review_manifest.py workers` to generate
the three host actions, including controller and store process scenarios.
After they pass, generate the portable full check with
`python3 crates/controller/tools/worker_review_manifest.py workspace`.
Submit each generated manifest with `pbcampaign.py --detach`.
