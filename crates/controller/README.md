# TL3 controller

`tl3-controller` connects the pure kernel to the Postgres store and upstream
executors. Read [the architecture note](../../docs/architecture.md) for the
transaction and recovery contracts.

All commands use the same TOML configuration as `tl3-config`. Controller execution
supports explicit simulation only. Status commands read the configured store
and do not load GitHub or model credentials.

Both commands use `Config::load`, which checks secret-file metadata, including
the optional store password. Only the store reads its password at runtime.
`tl3 status` uses `Reader::open`. It never migrates or writes and
reports an uninitialized database clearly.

```text
tl3 status --config /absolute/path/to/config.toml
tl3 status-serve --config /absolute/path/to/config.toml
tl3d --config /absolute/path/to/config.toml --simulate /absolute/path/to/fake-records
```

The daemon reads one JSON `cli::Input` per line on stdin. For example:

```json
{"LabelledIssue":{"delivery":"fixture-42","owner":"RobTand","repo":"tl3-sandbox","installation":1,"number":42,"title":"Fix the sandbox build","actor":24923402,"label":"tl3"}}
```

The example repository, installation and actor must match the configuration.
Fake receipts live outside the controller process. Keep their directory when
restarting against the same database. `--drain` recovers persisted work and exits
without reading stdin. EOF ends an interactive simulation.

Register a replacement executor with one `Registry::register` call. The five
modules under `src/adapters` each contain a fake. The controller owns interning
and persistence. Executors own authoritative reconciliation and epoch fencing.
`adapters::simulation` is currently the only registry builder. A test starts
with it and replaces one entry with `register`. The `mixed_registry` scenario
uses the real `tl3-worktrees` client in a temporary repository and delegates
the remaining worktree effects to its fake. The other four upstreams stay fake.

Each adapter ticket extends `Delivery` with the fields its real client needs.
The tracer does not predefine issue text, branch text, or PR text fields.

`tl3 status` and the page share `status::load`, one typed model and one set
of columns. They show the issue title and number, phase, wait, credit, last
progress and open incidents. Older requests without a title show "title not
recorded". Both progress and incidents show "none recorded" until their store
data exists. Tickets #9 and #15 fill `status::load_request_details`. It takes all
node IDs at once and returns a map from node ID to `RequestDetails`, using batch
queries on the existing read-only transaction. Missing entries use the empty
details. Return public summaries there, never
worker payloads, connection settings or tokens.

`tl3 status-serve` is a separate process from `tl3d`. It serves `/` with GET
and HEAD, needs no login and refuses other methods with 405. Reload the page
to refresh it. The server uses `config.status.listen`; the example binds only
to `127.0.0.1:8033`. Initialize the database through the controller before
opening status. Status checks the schema and migration version before reading;
an empty database reports "database not initialized". Status never runs migrations
or creates request data. After a connection failure, the page reopens its single
reader and retries once. Failed reads return a generic 503.

The synchronous HTTP server uses four handler threads and caps accepted open
connections at eight, including queued clients. Extra connections close immediately.
Reading headers and writing each response have separate two-second total deadlines.
Each socket requests a 32 KiB send buffer to bound queued replies.
Response writes use chunks and the remaining deadline, so trickle readers cannot
keep a handler indefinitely. Accept errors are logged and skipped; file-table
exhaustion also backs off briefly. Each 503 logs its cause to stderr without
including it in the HTTP body. Queries on `/` are ignored. Request lines plus headers are
limited to 8 KiB. Request bodies are rejected and every response closes its
connection. Responses keep the content security policy and disable caching.

Ticket #19 owns deployment on dl380g10, the systemd unit and the LAN address.
The page has no authentication. Run the status process in its own unit and set
`[status].listen` to the LAN interface's specific address, never `0.0.0.0` or
`[::]`. The status connection uses the `[store]` settings. A SELECT-only
Postgres role can also restrict the status process's credentials.

Run development verification through PrismaBuild from a clean commit:

```bash
python3 /mnt/shared/prismabuild-fleet/repo/tools/pbrun.py \
  --cwd "$PWD" --anywhere --cpus 2 --demand mem_gb=6 --priority -10 \
  --env PATH=/home/rob/.cargo/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin \
  --env RUSTUP_HOME=/home/rob/.rustup --env CARGO_HOME=/home/rob/.cargo \
  --env CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 --env RUST_TEST_THREADS=2 \
  --env OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 --env MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 --env OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 \
  --detach -- bash crates/controller/tools/verify.sh
```

Run this from the repository root. Use `pbwait.py --endings KEY` and inspect the
exit code, logs and verified CAS receipt. CI runs separately on Mergify runners.

## GitHub ingress in simulation

`ingress::Source` runs on its own thread and sends `cli::Input` values to one
controller thread. Register a source with `Sources::register`. The stdin reader
uses that same interface. `Sources::run` drains persisted deliveries before
applying inputs and drives the controller until no work remains. Every source
exit is logged. An error or panic wakes and stops the controller loop immediately,
so `tl3d` exits and systemd can restart it while other sources are still alive.

To exercise the receiver against a local GitHub mock server, supply
`--github-listen 127.0.0.1:8081 --github-api http://127.0.0.1:8082/` alongside
`--simulate`. `github.webhook_listen` in the TOML file also sets the listen
address. With `--github-api` and no explicit listen address, the receiver defaults
to `127.0.0.1:8081`. Config and bind reject non-loopback addresses. `cloudflared`
on the same host forwards its tunnel to this socket. The mock App credentials come from `github.app_credentials_file`.
The API must be loopback HTTP in this simulation release. Ordinary stdin
simulation still needs no App credentials. Live startup and tunnel deployment
remain tickets #20 and #19.

POST deliveries to `/github/events`, matching the App manifest, with GitHub's
delivery, event and signature headers. Other methods return 405 with `Allow: POST`.
The status page and receiver share `src/http.rs`. Four handlers cap open
connections at eight, including queued sockets. Headers have an 8 KiB limit and
webhook bodies have a 25 MiB limit. Oversized bodies return 413, transfer
encoding returns 400, and webhook POST
requires `Content-Length`. Socket reads finish before reaching the receiver
thread, so a stalled client cannot hold delivery persistence or catch-up.
Accept errors are logged and skipped. Response writes have a total deadline too.

The library verifies the HMAC before parsing. The receiver stores
the event name, delivery id and unchanged raw bytes in `tl3_ingress` before returning
202. Replay parses them into the current `GitHubDelivery::Webhook` type, including
unknown event names. Rows that no longer parse log their delivery id and advance
every consumer past the row, so an older payload cannot crash-loop startup.
PR updates, check runs, check suites and merge groups remain available for their
owning adapters. Persistence errors log their `Display`,
reopen the ingress connection and retry once. Only a failed retry returns 503.
Delivery ids remain unique while retained. After retirement, repeated deliveries
still use the same durable intake and observation keys. A crash between applying
an input and advancing its consumer cursor replays the same intake or observation key.

`Webhooks` runs catch-up once at startup. Ticket #19 wires the tunnel supervisor
to `WebhookControl::gap` after an outage. Gap and stop notifications wake the
receiver's blocking channel. There is no polling timer. A failed persistence or
response marks a gap, which is retried at the next receiver event. Catch-up stores
`GitHubDelivery::CatchUp` with the full `RepoChanges` and its cursor in one
transaction, including PRs and check results. Comment URLs compare repository
names without case and use the trailing issue number. Rob's comments on issues
and PRs enter `github_comments` in both paths, deduplicated by repository,
installation and comment id. Ticket #14 classifies them.

Headers have a two-second total read deadline. Body reads get a separate total
budget of at least two seconds, scaled at 1 MiB/s by the declared length and
capped at 25 seconds for GitHub's 25 MiB limit. The listener is loopback-only
behind `cloudflared`. Failed reads never trigger catch-up because their bytes
are unauthenticated. Ticket #15 will read GitHub's failed-delivery records on a look.

One ingress connection inserts webhooks and catch-up rows in commit order.
Sequence cursors depend on this single-writer invariant: a concurrent inserter
could allocate a lower sequence and commit it after consumers had passed it.
The controller's separate connection advances cursors and retires rows.

### Register a delivery translator

PR #69 registers its Mergify translator, and #13 registers its PR translator,
on the controller before `Sources::run` or `ingress::drain`:

```rust
controller.register_github_translator("mergify", mergify_translator);
```

Implement `ingress::GitHubTranslator::translate(&mut self, &GitHubDelivery,
&tl3_store::Snapshot) -> Result<Vec<cli::Input>>`. Translate both `Webhook` and
`CatchUp` variants into observations. Validate the served repository and
installation before producing evidence, and use stable observation keys across
webhook and catch-up overlap. Translators never call the kernel.

`ingress::drain` reads the stored deliveries in arrival order, calls the
translator on the controller thread, applies its inputs and then persists its
`github-translator:<name>` sequence in `tl3_ingress_consumers`. Each translator has
an independent cursor. A new name starts at intake's current durable position,
skipping consumed history even if another translator still retains it. Pending
deliveries and catch-up supply recent state. Reusing the name after restart resumes it.
An error leaves that delivery's cursor unchanged. Inputs must be idempotent
because a crash after applying them can replay the delivery. Intake and cursor advances delete rows in the same transaction once intake and
every registered translator have passed them. No clock drives retirement. The
registered set is reconciled before each drain, so removed translators stop retaining
rows. Each translator loads at most one world snapshot per batch.

`adapters::github::Adapter` uses the REST client for kernel notices. It invokes
`workers::writer::Writer`, checks every draft and allows two correction attempts.
Three rejected drafts return a permanent acknowledgement, so recovery does not
restart the writer loop. A worker transport error stays uncertain.
`FakeWriter` returns fixed prose in simulation. The seam uses the existing writer
role's protocol v1 input and reply shapes. Questions retain the kernel's allowed
options. Closing summaries close the issue, except when the request is replaced.
PR effects still use this module's fake until ticket #13. Incident and replacement
notices also stay on the fake for their owning tickets. Incidents need the
operations issue, and replacements need a new request, not another comment.
The checker uses the request's own `Delivery.paths` and any further paths
supplied in the adapter policy. No build script inventories TL3's checkout.
It rejects both `:line` and `:line:column` suffixes.

The `github` integration target uses the recorded webhook fixtures, the actual
HTTP receiver, a local REST server and embedded Postgres. It covers delivery
persistence, unauthorized labels, gap recovery, duplicate reconciliation, writer
rejections, epoch fencing and SIGKILL after posting before acknowledgement.

For the review-fix evidence, create a clean detached worktree at the final
commit, then generate the campaign there:

```bash
python3 crates/controller/tools/review_manifest.py > /tmp/tl3-review-campaign.json
python3 /mnt/shared/prismabuild-fleet/repo/tools/pbcampaign.py --detach /tmp/tl3-review-campaign.json
```

The campaign adds the kernel tests and three Kani harnesses covering retryable
acknowledgements, publishing transitions, and queued progress. Read each terminal
record, log, and CAS receipt before reporting a pass.

For PR #64's receiver and status review evidence, create a clean detached worktree
at the final commit. From that worktree, submit the three host checks:

```bash
python3 crates/controller/tools/github_review_manifest.py > /tmp/tl3-github-review.json
python3 /mnt/shared/prismabuild-fleet/repo/tools/pbcampaign.py --detach /tmp/tl3-github-review.json
```

The manifest pins the controller, GitHub and Postgres test targets to `dl380g10`, `sparky`
and `sparklina`. Controller targets include the status page and process tests.
After they pass, submit the full workspace `tools/verify.sh` command shown above
once with `--anywhere`. Record every action key and result in the PR body.
