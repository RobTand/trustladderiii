# TL3 controller

`tl3-controller` connects the pure kernel to the Postgres store and upstream
executors. Read [the architecture note](../../docs/architecture.md) for the
transaction and recovery contracts.

All commands use the same TOML configuration as `tl3-config`. Controller execution
supports explicit simulation only. Status commands read the configured store
and do not load GitHub or model credentials.

Both commands use `Config::load`, which checks secret-file metadata, including
the optional store password. Only the store reads its password at runtime.
`tl3 status` uses `Reader::open`. It never migrates or writes and
reports an uninitialized database clearly.

```text
tl3 status --config /absolute/path/to/config.toml
tl3 status-serve --config /absolute/path/to/config.toml
tl3d --config /absolute/path/to/config.toml --simulate /absolute/path/to/fake-records
```

The daemon reads one JSON `cli::Input` per line on stdin. For example:

```json
{"LabelledIssue":{"delivery":"fixture-42","owner":"RobTand","repo":"tl3-sandbox","installation":1,"number":42,"title":"Fix the sandbox build","actor":24923402,"label":"tl3"}}
```

The example repository, installation and actor must match the configuration.
Fake receipts live outside the controller process. Keep their directory when
restarting against the same database. `--drain` recovers persisted work and exits
without reading stdin. EOF ends an interactive simulation.

Register a replacement executor with one `Registry::register` call. The five
modules under `src/adapters` each contain a fake. The controller owns interning
and persistence. Executors own authoritative reconciliation and epoch fencing.
`adapters::simulation` is currently the only registry builder. A test starts
with it and replaces one entry with `register`. The `mixed_registry` scenario
uses the real `tl3-worktrees` client in a temporary repository and delegates
the remaining worktree effects to its fake. The other four upstreams stay fake.

Each adapter ticket extends `Delivery` with the fields its real client needs.
The tracer does not predefine issue text, branch text, or PR text fields.

`tl3 status` and the page share `status::load`, one typed model and one set
of columns. They show the issue title and number, phase, wait, credit, last
progress and open incidents. Older requests without a title show "title not
recorded". Both progress and incidents show "none recorded" until their store
data exists. Tickets #9 and #15 fill `status::load_request_details`. It takes all
node IDs at once and returns a map from node ID to `RequestDetails`, using batch
queries on the existing read-only transaction. Missing entries use the empty
details. Return public summaries there, never
worker payloads, connection settings or tokens.

`tl3 status-serve` is a separate process from `tl3d`. It serves `/` with GET
and HEAD, needs no login and refuses other methods with 405. Reload the page
to refresh it. The server uses `config.status.listen`; the example binds only
to `127.0.0.1:8033`. Initialize the database through the controller before
opening status. Status checks the schema and migration version before reading;
an empty database reports "database not initialized". Status never runs migrations
or creates request data. After a connection failure, the page reopens its single
reader and retries once. Failed reads return a generic 503.

The std-only HTTP server uses four handler threads and caps accepted open
connections at eight, including queued clients. Extra connections close immediately.
Reading headers and writing each response have separate two-second total deadlines.
Response writes use chunks and the remaining deadline, so trickle readers cannot
keep a handler indefinitely. Accept errors are logged and skipped; file-table
exhaustion also backs off briefly. Each 503 logs its cause to stderr without
including it in the HTTP body. Queries on `/` are ignored. Request lines plus headers are
limited to 8 KiB. Request bodies are rejected and every response closes its
connection. Responses keep the content security policy and disable caching.

Ticket #19 owns deployment on dl380g10, the systemd unit and the LAN address.
The page has no authentication. Run the status process in its own unit and set
`[status].listen` to the LAN interface's specific address, never `0.0.0.0` or
`[::]`. The status connection uses the `[store]` settings. A SELECT-only
Postgres role can also restrict the status process's credentials.

Run development verification through PrismaBuild from a clean commit:

```bash
python3 /mnt/shared/prismabuild-fleet/repo/tools/pbrun.py \
  --cwd "$PWD" --anywhere --cpus 2 --demand mem_gb=6 --priority -10 \
  --env PATH=/home/rob/.cargo/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin \
  --env RUSTUP_HOME=/home/rob/.rustup --env CARGO_HOME=/home/rob/.cargo \
  --env CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 --env RUST_TEST_THREADS=2 \
  --env OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 --env MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 --env OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 \
  --detach -- bash crates/controller/tools/verify.sh
```

Run this from the repository root. Use `pbwait.py --endings KEY` and inspect the
exit code, logs and verified CAS receipt. CI runs separately on Mergify runners.

For the review-fix evidence, create a clean detached worktree at the final
commit, then generate the campaign there:

```bash
python3 crates/controller/tools/review_manifest.py > /tmp/tl3-review-campaign.json
python3 /mnt/shared/prismabuild-fleet/repo/tools/pbcampaign.py --detach /tmp/tl3-review-campaign.json
```

The campaign adds the kernel tests and three Kani harnesses covering retryable
acknowledgements, publishing transitions, and queued progress. Read each terminal
record, log, and CAS receipt before reporting a pass.
